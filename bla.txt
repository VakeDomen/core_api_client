Data reveal that with the long-term presence of the international lobster economy, Kuri has become increasingly matrilocal, matrifocal, and matrilineal. Female-centered social practices in Kuri represent broader patterns in Middle America caused by indigenous menu0027s participation in the global economy. Indigenous women now play heightened roles in preserving cultural, linguistic, and social identities. (Gender, power, kinship, Miskitu women, Honduras) Along the Miskito Coast of northeastern Honduras, indigenous Miskitu men have participated in both subsistence-based and outside economies since the colonial era. For almost 200 years, international companies hired Miskitu men as wage-laborers in u0022boom and bustu0022 extractive economies, including gold, bananas, and mahogany. During boom times, men worked away from the villages, while women and children lived in matrilocal residential groups where, in the absence of adult men, women passed down language and identity to the children (Helms 1971). Conversely, patrilocal residential patterns were restored during bust phases of the economy, when men returned to their subsistence labors. While men became more acculturated to outside cultures, Miskitu women stayed behind as societyu0027s conservative cultural core. Therefore, the Miskitu peopleu0027s practice of matrilocal residence proved to be a successful social adaptation to boom times in the coastal economy (Helms 1971:23-28). Helmsu0027s research (in the late 1960s) in the community of Asang, along the Rio Coco in Nicaragua, was completed just after a decline in the mahogany timber industry (Helms 1971:31, 232). Asang men then did agricultural labor close to home, and residence was patrilocal. In contrast to Helms, my research along the Honduran Miskito Coast in the late 1990s depicts Miskitu society during a boom in the international (Honduras-US) lobster economy. In Kuri, a Miskitu village (pop. 175), men lived away from their communities on lobstering boats, and women and children lived in matrilocal groups. Helms (1971) would attribute the different social and gendered practices in Asang in the 1960s and Kuri in the 1990s to the effects of the boom and bust economy. My work supports and furthers Helmsu0027s analysis by demonstrating that the most recent ETHNOLOGY vol. 46 no. 2, Spring 2007, pp. 133-149. ETHNOLOGY, c/o Department of Anthropology. The University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15260 USA Copyright o 2008 The University of Pittsburgh. All rights reserved. 133 134 ETHNOLOGY boom in the lobster economy (1970s to the present) has caused Honduran Miskitu society to develop increasingly female-centered social practices. While other researchers have reported matrilocality among Miskitu peoples (Dennis 2004; Garcia 1996a, 1996b; Helms 1971; Jamieson 2000; Peter 2002), this is the first time in the ethnographic literature that a researcher can demon-strate that Miskitu society has become matrifocal and even matrilineal. Analysis suggests that womenu0027s power has increased in Miskitu society due to changes in residence patterns, domestic organization, and descent that have developed along with the lobster-diving economy.2 The present article views Miskitu womenu0027s main power as vested in their ability to craft everyday social identities and kin-ship relations (Blackwood 2000:7,187). Their power lies beyond the scope of the Honduran state, which recognizes male surnames and males as legitimate heads of households. This article first identifies matrifocal characteristics found in Kuri, including male absenteeism and matrilocal residential patterns. Then it compares Helmsu0027s 1960s data to my 1990s data to show that matrilineal descent practices have taken hold along the Honduran Caribbean coast. MATRIFOCALITY Smith (1956) coined the term matrifocal to refer to black Caribbean families in British Guyana that lived in consanguineal households and practiced post-marital matrilocal residence.3 Gonzalez (1970, 1988), who worked among the Gariruna (Black Carib) on the Guatemalan Caribbean coast, characterizes matri-focality by two predominant features: u0022consanguineal co-residential kinshipu0022 and u0022mother-centeredu0022 families, whereby mothers are dominant in the family and play the leading role psychologically. Many other researches have identified mother-centered families as a predominant feature of matrifocality (Belmonte 1989, Blackwood 2005, Bragger and Gilmore 1997,Mohammed 1986, Scott 1995,and Tanner 1974). In Kuri, consanguineal households and mother-centered families prevail. Young couples in Kuri almost always live near the wifeu0027s family after marriage. A Miskitu song, originally performed in the Miskitu language by W. Suarez and E. Guevara, reveals local attitudes toward marriage and residence. The song title below refers to a future mother-in-law and father-in-law. Taihka, Taihka, Tahti, Tahti (Auntie, Auntie, Uncle, Uncle) Auntie, Auntie, Auntie, Uncle, Uncle, Uncle I want your daughter to be mine I will buy her a chicken, a pig MISKITU WOMENu0027S POWER 135 and build her a house close lo your home Aunlie. Aunlic. Aumic. I want your daughter lo be mine I will build her a house close to your home Miskitu couples often choose lo live in the wifeu0027s parentsu0027 house for u00dc short lime while the husband accumulates money and resources to build a house on land given to ihem by ihc wifeu0027s mother. Thereafter, the home is called or referred lo by (he name of the wife using the possessive: e.g., Toinassau0027s house. Similarly, in Sumatra, land is inherited in Minangkabau society through (he female line; even when men build a house for (heir family, the house is immedi-ately understood to be the womanu0027s properly thai she will pass on through the female line (Blackwood 2000, 2005; Sanday 2002). The land given to daughters in Kuri typically surrounds the motheru0027s house, and eventually a group of sisters and their familiesu0027 homes would encircle the motheru0027s patio. In 1997, the village geographically divided itself into live matri-groups that account for 22 out of 25 houses (Herlihy 2006:45-46). Mothers, daughters, and sisters form the core of the matrigroup. living near each other their entire lives. The social and economic tics between these women arc the most enduring and important in Miskitu society (Garcia 1996a, 1996b; Helms 1971; Peter 2002). With lime, the mother becomes known as a kuka (grandmother and respected elder). Grandmothers possess pharmaceutical knowledge and are responsible for keeping members of the matrigroup emotionally, spiritually, and physically healthy. A kuka rules over all her descendants as the local expert and enforcer of correct kinship, social, and economic behaviors. A kuka can be both respected and feared. In ihc matrigroup where the researcher lived, everyone called Kuka Dcnecela by the nickname u0022Dofia CES.u0022 CES. an acronym, stands for the police force that worked in the region. Others called her u0022kuka militaru0022 (military grandmother). The author also heard sons-in-law jokingly referred to as alhahuina (literally, slave meat) because of their subservient position as resource providers to the households of their molhcrs-in-law. Stivens (1996) and Peletz (1994) refer to the power of mothers-in-law in Malaysia as u0027u0022queen control.u0022 This refers lo the psychological effect on Malaysian (related to Minangkabau peoples) sons-in-law who are teased about their weak position in their wifeu0027s family. Female-Headed Households In 1998 women headed most Kuriu0027s households (Table 1). Single mothers headed ten households where no man lived permanently in the husband-father 136 ETHNOLOGY role. Women also headed 11 households while their husbands were away working (Herlihy 2006:47-48). Table 1 Household Composition 1991 1998 Total households 22 25 Total female-headed 19 21 Husband away working 11 11 Single CO 10 Table 2 Single Mothers and Household Structure in Kuri Total number of mothers 32 Total number of single mothers 14 Single mothers heading households 10 Single mothers living in their mothersu0027 households 4 Nearly half of all mothers were not married (see Table 2), and some of these women continued to live with their mothers (Herlihy, 2006:47-48). These house-holds were similar to the Gariruna u0022consanguinealu0022 households described by Gonzalez (1969,1970), where mothers, daughters, and their children formed the domestic group. Gonzalez (1970:1-12) called these groups u0022matrifocal units,u0022 where a senior woman, a single mother herself, lived with her unmarried daughters, their children, and at times, some unmarried sons (see also Tanner 1974:132). In Kuriu0027s female-headed households, the mothers* brothers and older sons contributed money to the households and held positions of authority over the children. Male-Absenteeism Since the early 1970s Miskitu men have worked as deep-water divers on boats owned by businessmen from the Honduran Bay Islands (Dodds 1998). The divers hunt spiny lobsters (Panulirus Argus) that are sold in Florida to restaurant chains in the United States, such as Red Lobster, Inc. During the 1997-98 season, 35 of 39 men in Kuri were employed as canoe men (cayuceros) and lobster divers (buzos). The buzos usually earn from US$150 to US$300 on each trip; but diving MISKITU WOMENu0027S POWER 137 for lobsters, like hunting, relies on luck, and men can return empty handed. During the diving season (from August to March), men usually take two trips to sea every month, staying in their villages just a few days before leaving again. In the off-season (from April through July), men work upriver in seasonal agricultural and hunting camps. Only four of 33 men over the age of 13 were present on a daily basis in Kuri (Herlihy 2006:47). Kuri men, then, participate in both migrant wage-labor and migrant subsistence activities, where coastal villages are located a dayu0027s distance from Plu00e4tano Miskitu agricultural and hunting lands. Each year, men rebuild their seasonal agricultural and hunting camps (champas), where they live during the off-season (Herlihy 2005:37-38). Not only does the lobster industry take men offshore for long periods of time, but men also live much of the year up-river in their camps that are one or two days travel away from the villages. Kuri had 25 houses and 175 people in 1998. Tables 3 and 4 depict those claiming to be permanent residents in Kuri households, but do not indicate a major characteristic of village lifeu2014the missing men. The actual population by age (see Table 5) reveals that Kuri is mainly composed of women and children less than 12 years of age. Many researchers have stressed the fact that with matrifocal units, men are often absent from their household for long periods (Bregger and Gilmore 1997; Gonzalez 1969,1970; Mohammed 1986; Rasmussen 1996; Scott 1995), which in turn causes the formation of female-headed households. Among the Tuareg of northern Africa, matrifocality is an adaptive mechanism, whereby groups of women band together when the men are gone for work or on trading expeditions (Rasmussen 1996). Under similar conditions, female bonding also is reported for Mediterranean cultures (Brettell 1986, Brogger 1992, Cole 1991). Most all of the characteristics that researchers note for matrifocality revolve around the central role of the mother when there is a u0022missing man,u0022 where the father plays a limited role in the family. But Blackwood (2005) contends that womenu0027s power with matrifocality is not caused by or contingent upon menu0027s absence. Building on Butleru0027s (2002) argument that Western notions of kinship are based on heteronormative assumptions of kinship as based on a man-woman marriage, a nuclear family, and the u0022Patriarchal Manu0022 as the main wage-earner and head of household, Blackwood (2005:8-10; see also Lamphere 2005) believes that these views cause anthropologists to emphasize marriages as aberrant or weak in matrifocal communities, while ignoring the womenu0027s other forms of relatedness, such as partnerships. Blackwoodu0027s (2005) and Sandayu0027s (2002) analyses of Sumatran society did not consider the effect that male migration has on womenu0027s power. My analysis differs with theirs because I examine the direct influence of male absence caused 138 ETHNOLOGY by the global economy on gendered power. Blackwoodu0027s (2000) data show that about 30 percent of the men were gone in her community, whereas in Kuri, 90 percent of the males over the age of 13 were absented from the village daily.

A Miskitu song (also performed by W. Suarezand E. Guevara) about men who come from afar to marry women along the coast and often return home after their marriages have fallen apart, tells of what frequently occurs in Kuri: women have sexual liaisons with men while their husbands or boyfriends are away at sea. As such, marriages between Kuri women and men are unstable. By the time a woman is approaching the end of her reproductive years (around 40), she generally has had a series of quasi-monogamous relationships with men that resulted in children. Men seem to have more spouses over their lifetime than do women, but this could not be verified because their children lived in other villages (Herlihy 2006:49). Young women in Kuri generally begin having romantic relationships around age 15 or 16; they are mothers by the time they are 18, and have six to eight children on average. Most have no access to birth control. Table 6 displays the number of spouses with whom women in Kuri claimed to have produced children. u0022Of 32 mothers in Kuri, 13 claim to have had children from only one man; 12 claim they have had children from two to three spouses; and seven admitted to having had children from four to five different spousesu0022 (Herlihy 2006:48). The numbers are conservative because women often lied during inter-views to hide the fact that some of their children were produced from outside or illicit unions; and most of the women who claimed to have had only one spouse were young and just beginning to have relationships with men. Gonzalez (1969,1970) and Wekker (2006) both argue that low male salience among the Garifuna and Surinamese Creoles has to do with unstable unions (weak marriages) between husbands and wives. Wekker (2006) finds that Surinam women have several short relations with various men, and even other women, who may temporarily become domestic and sexual partners. She (Wekker 2006) claims that because men and women have multiple and temporary unions, a womanu0027s lover has no permanent ties to the household and is not necessarily the father of her children. Adopted Kin Cook (1992:156) says the weaker role that men play in matrifocal families is due to low male salience, and thus they have little influence over family members when a high incidence of illegitimacy occurs and men are not the biological father of children in the household. With the constantly shifting membership of 140 ETHNOLOGY Table 6 Number of Womenu0027s Marital Unions H of women # of spouses that produced children 13 1 6 2 6 3 4 4 313 51 matrifocal households and the high incidence of temporary boarders, Stack (1974) reported that men in the husband-father role often felt no legal or moral right to control the behaviors and actions of household members. Fonseca (1991) found a similar situation in Brazil, where poor families had many non-permanent adoptions of children. In these situations, men who live only for a short while in the household have little control over the actions of their wifeu0027s relatives. Children in Kuri are often given to the care of their grandmothers or aunts. Teenage girls were especially in demand to cook, wash clothes, and help with child care. Many mothers lent their daughters to their mothers and sisters, even from birth. These female children grow up using dual systems of kinship, calling two or more women u0022Mamau0022 or u0022Yapti,u0022 and assuming the corresponding terminology for all others in the two households. Thus, a child may call many women u0022mamau0022 throughout life (see also Stack 1974). Three of PCukau0027s daughters were the closest of sisters, despite being raised in different houses. A system of u0022keeping-while-givingu0022 (Weiner 1992) occurred where the exchange of daughters maintained ties between households of the matrilocal group. It mattered little in which household one was raised; all des-cendants of the Kuka inherit land from their parents and share in subsistence, game meat, and other resources. Adoptions can be temporary or last a lifetime, but are not usually legally sanctioned. Almost 40 percent of Kuri households in 1998 had half-siblings as members and 36 percent of the households included adopted children. In almost all cases, the children are adopted from the motheru0027s side, coming from within the matri-local group. Half of all households claimed to have had an adopted child of a female relative living there in the past, and many more households had children as temporary borders over the years. Households constantly changed and children often lived between two or more homes (see also Stack 1974). MISKITU WOMENu0027S POWER 141 Exogamy That matrifocality occurs when men from other regions emigrate for work and then experience seasonal unemployment (Cook 1992, Breggerand Gilmore 1997) holds true for many Kuri men. They go to the coast to find work as lobster divers and live with local women. Later, the men return to their families up-river or in other regions, leaving behind their coastal wives and children. I interviewed 32 women to find out where the fathers of their children were from, before coming to Kuri (see Table 7). Most Kuri women (60 percent) marry men from outside of the north coast villages, between Barra Plu00e4tano and loans, and up the Plu00e4tano and Paulaya Rivers. Table 7 Womenu0027s Level of Exogamy Women who had children with someone from within the village 3 Women who had children with someone from within the reserve region 24 Women who had children with someone from outside the reserve region 38 Because women married men from outside of the village, region, and ethnic group, women knew more than most men about village histories, genealogies, and local folklore. Significantly, men typically did not know local kinship relations, the proper terms of reference, or reciprocity obligations in their wifeu0027s family. Both male absenteeism and exogamy created a situation where women of the matrigroup became the primary transmitters of language, culture, and kinship practices to the children. (Herlihy 2002). Matrifocality in urban Brazil places emphasis on close ties with oneu0027s matrilineal kin and where a complex web of relations [is] constructed around the domestic group in which, even with the presence of a man in the house, the womanu0027s side of the group is favored. This is evidenced in mother-child relations being more solidary than father-child relations, in the choice of residence, in the identification of known relatives, in exchange of goods and services, in visiting patterns and so on. All are stronger on the female side. (Scott 1995:287) MATRILINY A comparison of kinship data from Asang and Kuri demonstrates the trend toward matriliny in Kuri. Patrilocal residential patterns in Asang were combined 142 ETHNOLOGY with a patrilineal system of kinship and descent (Helms 1971). The nuclear family household (headed by a male in the husband-father role) tied into the larger or patrilineal descent group (kiamp), which included all members related through the male line. Fathers, brothers, and sons lived near each other through-out their lives. With patrilocality and patrilineality co-existing, all men and children of the patrilocal group claimed membership in the same kiamp, and had the same surname. The kinship term kiamp, used with its male surname, such as Ferrera kiamp, referred to all members of the patrilineal descent group and to the area of the village where the family lived: . . . Asang can be identified as groups of people related to each other through kinship. In this sense the village loses a common unity and is seen instead as composed of many kiampsu2014kinship groups to which an individual belongs by virtue of having the same family name. Because of the pattern of marital residence, the kiamps tend to occupy separate geographical locations within the village. (Helms 1971:54-55) At the time of Helmsu0027s study in the late 1960s, Asang residents conceptualized the village as consisting of 27 kiamps with separate geographical locations (Helms 1971:55, 74). Helms shows on a map of the village that the Sanders, Joseph, and Bobb kiamps occupied the largest family grounds, although she states that the kiamp does not hold property. Garciau0027s (1996b) later study of Asang found that the male surname shared by a man and his descendants continued to define the kiamp. But sisters of the matrigroup who share a male surname uphold ties of the kiamp, and that u0022house-holds connect to the other households of the community with whom they share a common surname. In this way the Asang kiamp is formed and is generally located in the same delimited space as the maternal lineu0022 (Garcia 1996b:7). Garciau0027s conclusions differ from Helmsu0027s in finding Asang to have matrilocally organized patrilineal groups. Comparing village social organization in Asang and Kuri reveals that different forms of marriage and household composition occur, causing Kuri to have a more female-centered domestic organization. In the larger community of Asang, 27 kiamps (symbolized by male surnames) occupied separate areas; in Kuri, the village could be divided into five neighbor-hoods, each dominated by a matrigroup. The basic kinship group in Kuri is the household, which is tied into the matrilocal group, the main socioeconomic support network. Each matrigroup is called by a kukau0027s name, such as u0022Lyvian kiampka,u0022 and cannot be identified by a male surname.

The Plu00e4tano Miskitu women give the fatheru0027s surname to their offspring, whether or not she marries the childu0027s father. The combination of serial monogamy and patronymy creates families where brothers and sisters, related through their motheru0027s side, often have different surnames. The half-siblings and any additional adopted siblings all retain different surnames. As a result, Kuka Denecelau0027s matrigroup (composed of five households) had 35 individuals with 20 different surnames in 1998 (Tables 11 and 12). Thus, the kiamp, as described by Helms and Garcia, has diminished or never existed on the coast. Table 11 Number of Surnames per Household in Kuri Households in Kuka Denecelau0027s matrigroup 1991 1998 Kuka Denecelau0027s household 4 4 Delflnau0027s household 5 5 I labiau0027s household 2 2 Enemeciau0027s household 3 3 Tomassau0027s household 4 6 MISKITU WOMENu0027S POWER 145 Table 12 Number of Surnames per Matrigroup 1991 1997 Surnames per matrigroup 17 20 Most significantly, the kiamp no longer functions to create ties between members of the patrilineal descent group. Many men who emigrated to the coast to work married locally and later returned home, thus deserting their wives. In these cases, children were raised almost entirely by the motheru0027s side of the family and rarely knew their fatheru0027s relatives. In other cases, members of the same kiamp on the coast can be in conflict. For example, if a man has or has had different wives along the coast, his children from these women can all have the same surname. Yet, these relationships can breed jealousies and rivalries between would be co-wives. These families (technically of the same kiamp) do not share resources and try to avoid each other, often attending different churches. Older residents of Kuri still understand the word kiampka to refer to oneu0027s fatheru0027s family, such as Ferrera kiampka. Younger ones, however, use the term kiamp (without the suffix) to refer to oneu0027s seasonal agricultural camp. Work there is shared by members of the matrigoup and people increasingly also use the term kiamp to refer to a matrigroup, such as u0022Lyvian kiampka,u0022 a land-owning residential kin group that traces descent through females. For the coastal Miskitu, the kiamp or patrilineal descent group no longer functions to create societyu0027s most important social and economic ties. Instead, the socioeconomic ties between members of the matrigroup have greater import. Matrilineal descent seems to thrive in Kuri beneath a facade of patronymy, where children inherit their fatheru0027s surname. Therefore, matrilocal residence, matrifocal families, and increasingly matrilineal kinship practices co-occur in Kuri to create an intensely female-centered society. GENDER, POWER, AND CULTURAL CONSERVATION Contradictory gender and power relations propagate in Kuri, where matrifocal structures exist alongside strong patriarchal norms. Matrifocal societies cross-culturally report similar gender and power relations (Smith 1956,1996; Gonzalez 1984; Brogger and Gilmore 1997). Miskitu society interacts with masculinized discourses of the Honduran state, patriarchal Western religions, and transnational economies. These interactions have caused sexual segregation, a gendered divi-sion of labor, and a male-dominant gender ideology to develop in Miskitu 146 ETHNOLOGY society. Menu0027s power has been solidified over the last 200 years through a political economy where employment opportunities have existed for men only. However, migrant-wage labor and male absenteeism have led to an increase in womenu0027s power. Miskitu womenu0027s power lies in the multiplicity of everyday constructions of social relations and practices, and is vested in their ability to create and recreate u0022traditionalu0022 knowledge, kinship relations, and social identi-ties. Using a Foucaultian perspective, Blackwood (2000:14) defines power as the control over social identities in rural communities. This is expressed in the construction and reconstitution of social relations and in the ability to construct and maintain social identities. Rather than imagining single nodes of power, such as those vested, for instance, in positions of authority (titled men, chiefs, or elders), 1 envision power residing in a multiplicity of nodes and interlinkages that together constitute the processes and practices of social life. Power, then, should be viewed not only as a public phenomenon, as in Western narratives, but also functions in the crafting of everyday social relations. Indeed, eco-feminists and indigenous feminists believe that womenu0027s power comes from their roles as maintainers of tradition, spiritual advisers, and healers, none of which yields economic power in capitalism (Cunningham 2003:1). Similarly, indigenous Miskitu womenu0027s power rests in their ability to control cultural and linguistic resources. Cross-culturally, womenu0027s roles as mothers provide them the venue through which they pass down culture and language to children. For indigenous and ethnic peoples making their living in an expanding global market economy, mothers take on a value-laden responsibility as cultural transmitters. Neoliberal economic policies are believed responsible for driving down prices in national markets, making it harder for indigenous men to earn a living in agricultural labor. These men then seek work in foreign economies and migrate from their homes to earn wages. In these cases, indigenous women become stewards of important resources and the primary transmitters of autochthonous practices. Indigenous women play central roles in the conservation of world-wide cultural diversity, especially regarding disappearing languages and healing knowledge. Conservation and development organizations specifically seek out Plu00e4tano Miskitu women as participants in their projects.4 Indigenous Miskitu women in coastal Honduran communities increasingly assume responsibility for the social reproduction of identities and ultimately for preserving worldwide cultural and linguistic diversity. MISKITU WOMENu0027S POWER 147 NOTES 1. This field research was supported by an I IE Fulbright Grant to Honduras (1997) and a Tinker Foundation Field Research Grant (2002), through the Center of Latin American Studies, University of Kansas. 2. Anthropological theories of kinship and gender, beginning with Martin and Voorhics (1975) and Friedl (1975), build on the premise that women have higher status in societies with matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent than in societies characterized by patrilocality and patriliny. This view applies to horticulturally based societies like the Miskitu, where womenparticipated in subsistence activities. 3. Interest in matrifocality flourished since the 1970s, when female-headed households increased dramatically in the United States. Brogger and Gilmore (1997:13) recount the variety of terms that researchers have used to refer to matrifocality, such as u0022women-centered kinship networksu0022 (Yanagisako 1977, Cole 1991), u0022matricentricu0022 (Brettell 1986), and what Willems (1962) called u0022matripotestal.u0022 Mohammed (1986) claims that definitions of matrifocality in the social science literature include a general emphasis on women having high status, those who are the main wage earners, women controlling the household economy, and situations of male absenteeism. 4. This is especially true for the Miskitu that live in Kuri, within the boundaries of the Rio Plu00e4tano Biosphere Reserve, an internationally designated protected area. Here, women control many cultural and natural resources that the Plu00e4tano biosphere was established to protect. MOPAWI (Moskitia Pawisa) is the largest development organization in the reserve. Its early programs addressed economic and health needs of the residents, but now focus on bilingual education, land legalization, and resource rights. Many MOPAWI programs arc designed specifi-cally to assist indigenous women to maintain their communityu0027s cultural practices. For example, women record medicinal plant use and healing techniques, arts and crafts, and music and dance (Herlihy 2002). BIBLIOGRAPHY Belmonte, T. 1989. The Broken Fountain. 2 n d ed.

This book became quite controversial in ethnobiological circles (I addressed this topic at length in Chapter 8 of my 2011 book, Indigenous Knowledge, Ecology, and Evolutionary Biology).   As a result, there is a range of opinions concern-ing possible negative impacts of indigenous hunting of pinnipeds.  The pinniped species involved are four species of otariid pinniped:  the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus Schreber Otariidae), northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus Linnaeus Otariidae), California sea lion (Zalophus californianus Lesson Otariidae), and Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi Merriam Otariidae).  The booku2019s authors discuss two phocid pinnipeds: harbor seal (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus Phocidae) and northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris Gill Phocidae).  The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens Linnaeus Odobenidae) is also a species of interest. As an undergraduate and larval graduate student I participated in studies involving all of these species but the Guadalupe fur seal and the Pacific walrus, working on Southeast Farallon, Au00f1o Nuevo, and Santa Barbara Islands, and the Monterey Bay area in general. Handling and observing these species gives me some insight into the experiences involved in hunting such creatures without the benefit of firearms. Most of these species are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males weighing from 300 (northern fur seal) to 2000 kg (northern elephant seal).   This means that there is potential for a lot of meat, but it also suggests that there is  potential danger in taking on large and aggressive males, who are most vulnera-ble, but also at their most dangerous, during breeding seasons, which occur during spring and early summer Exploitation of wildlife populations by indigenous peoples typically involves exploitation of herbivores, such as bison, deer, or elk, or of fishes, such as salmon or halibut.  It is unusual for hunting societies to focus much of their attention on top carnivores in an ecological system. This unusual state of affairs and its long term ecological consequences are the topic of this collection of papers. In the marine environments along the Pacific Coast of North America and the Bering Sea, pinni-peds (seals, sea lions, and walrus) and sea otters are among the top predators. In addition, sea otters are considered to be a keystone predator responsible for structuring nearshore benthic communities.  These species are the largest warm-blooded animals that come onshore, and are thus available for hunting by humans along these coasts. One reason that it is possible for humans to hunt predators is that marine food chains are very different than terrestrial ones, because in marine systems predators are always larger than their prey, whereas in terrestrial systems prey, especially mammalian prey, can be as large or larger than their predators.  As with any edited collection, the individual chapters vary widely in both theme and quality.  One important subtheme in this collection is the question of the impact of humans upon populations of marine mammal carnivores.   Some of the papers in this collection are written by adherents to ideas developed by Brown University anthropologist Shepherd Krech.  These individuals, principally Hildebrandt and Jones, follow a tradition established by Krech, who became famous (or notorious) for his 1999 book, The Ecological Indian, which argued that the Native peoples of North America were not u201cgood ecologistsu201d and Human Impacts on Seals, Sea Lions, and Sea Otters: Integrating Archaeology and Ecology of the Northeast Pacific Edited by Todd J.

This winter breeding season also means that winter seas must be dealt with to exploit elephant seals, so it is not surprising that elephant seals, especially males, are the species taken least often as reported in the studies in this collection. The species taken least often after northern elephant seal is Steller sea lion, where the males can weigh up to a ton, which makes them one of the largest carnivores that ever lived. They have teeth the size of grizzly bears, a protective thick mane which gives them their name, plus they are very aggressive towards humans: an u201cexperimentu201d conducted by some of my colleagues on Au00f1o Nuevo using a human dummy resulted in the dummy being thrown into the ocean and torn apart by a bull Steller sea lion, after which everyone became much more cautious around male Steller sea lions.  Another factor that must be considered is the role of climate change and accompanying variation in environmental conditions over historical time.  Some of the studies in this collection, e.g. Hill (Chapter 3) and Crockford and Frederick, (Chapter 4) describe hunting regimes associated with ice cover, which came down as far as the Aleutians during the last 5000 years.  At ice maxima this would have prevented northern fur seal from breeding on the Pribilof Islands, which are their major breeding colonies today, because they would have been ice choked, even in midsummer, during the Neoglacial period (4700-2500 ybp).   Hillu2019s chapter is the only contribution that addresses exploitation of walrus.  Its major finding is that peoples of the Bering Strait area probably exploited walrus preferentially over bowhead whales for much of the last thousand years, and that whaling may have arisen largely as a response to declines in walrus populations. Evidence of contemporary whaling in the western Arctic is found primarily in areas that seemed to have previously been most dependent upon walrus.  This finding may have profound impacts upon the future hunting patterns of these peoples, because both walrus and bowheads (along with ringed seals and bearded seals [Erignathus barbatus Erxleben Phocidae]) are strongly ice depend-ent, and may no longer be available to indigenous populations as Arctic ice retreats under current conditions of climate change. Crockford, the senior author of Chapter 4, has become a controversial figure, considered to be a climate change denier in Canada.  This seems to be primarily because as an archaeologist, she believes that climates change constantly and that current variations might be considered natural variation in global conditions. This approach can be seen in her chapter where she argues that colder climates resulted in a major expansion of sea ice in the North Pacific and Bering Sea; that altered conditions led to changes in distribution and life history features of pagophilic pinnipeds; and that more temperate pinniped species, like sea lions and fur seals, were effectively excluded from this environment for a considerable period of time, which in turn had a major impact on patterns of human exploitation during this period.  A more comprehensive approach to studying exploitation patterns between humans and pinnipeds is shown in Chapters 5 and 6 by Betts, Meschner, and Lech, who examine a 4500 year time series of otariid and sea otter take on an island in the western Gulf of Alaska in relation to both climate change and human activities.  I found this to be one of the most interest-ing articles, even though the authors have a tendency to present graphs using straight lines to connect data points, e.g., from 2500 to 1750 to 590 BC as if conditions changed at a constant rate between those widely separated dates. Despite this issue with data presentation, the authors present a credible interpreta-tion, i.e., that a combination of climatic variation and human exploitation on both the local and metapopu-lation level explain the observed fluctuations, which over a period of two thousand years evolved into a sort of natural predator-prey equilibrium.  They argue that human predation does have significant impact upon otariid populations. Unlike the concepts developed by the Krech/Martin school of over exploitation and use of blitzkrieg metaphors, however, these scholars argue that pinnipeds quickly developed significant behavioral responses that allowed them to minimize negative impacts.  In addition, it appears that exploitation increased when population sizes increased in response to colder, more productive conditions, and declined during warmer, less produc-tive conditions, which is what would be expected from a natural predator-prey dynamic. In Chapter 5 Betts et al., rely heavily upon methods and concepts developed by R. Lee Lyman, author of the overview of Paleoecological research provided in Chapter 2 of this book. Lyman is critical of the Krechian perspective, arguing that it is hard to  34 Book Review estimate historical population sizes based solely upon taphonomic remains.  He points out that many archaeologists have difficulty identifying marine mammal remains to species level (ancient DNA has apparently been useful in revising earlier assessments).  Lyman also points out that few major museums have good collections of marine mammal skeletal material for comparative purposes. For example walrus skeletal material of varying antiquity shows up all over the North Pacific, but that walrus are never found in many of these areas today, so we should be skeptical of modern biogeography when identifying recent remains.   The role of historical biogeography is more important than is generally realized. For example, the two species of fur seal (northern fur seal and Guada-lupe fur seal) show complex histories over the last few centuries and millennia. Northern fur seals are found today primarily in subarctic waters during the breed-ing season, except for a small breeding population that exists on Californiau2019s San Miguel Island and may be the relict of a metapopulation that ranged from Alaska to California. Northern fur seal probably consisted of two or more distinct forms, possibly even distinct species: the current northern population and a second u201cspeciesu201d that ranged from coastal Washington southward. The Guadalupe fur seal, as implied by its name, until recently was found breeding exclusively south of the U. S.-Mexico border, howev-er historically it ranged at least as far north as the Farallon Islands (25 miles west of San Francisco) where it was extirpated by Euroamerican sealers in the 19th century (Busch 1987), and Lyman reports archaeological specimens from as far north as coastal Washington. The basic structure of the book after Lymanu2019s chapter is to move down the coast from Alaska and the Bering Sea through coastal Canada and then down the Pacific coast of the US from Washington to Californiau2019s Channel islands, although there is a large gap in that southern and southeastern Alaska and northern British Columbia are not covered at all.  For example the cultures of Haida Gwai are not even mentioned, although these may represent the most intact First Nations cultures along the entire coast and could thus provide considerable insight into historical phenomena. These gaps create some interesting complications, because not all of the investigators use the same approaches or come from the same philo-sophical perspectives. In a way this makes the book more compelling because it does not really come to any obvious consensus. As one example, some of the authors make periodic stabs at applying optimal foraging theory, usually in that odd way that anthropologists employ concepts from behavioral ecology.  In chapter 6, which has the same authors as Chapter 5, but in different order, they make the argument that, u201cThe prey choice model predicts that as the availability of large bodied taxa decline, predation of smaller bodied and lower-ranked taxa increasesu201d (p. 111). What goes unacknowledged is that this theorem was developed after watching great tits choose mealworms of various sizes off a conveyer belt.  This means that search and handling times were not assessed, which suggests it may not be applicable as to whether human foragers preferentially select 300-1000 kg otariids as opposed to 100 kg phocids or 30 kg sea otters as food.  Although this point may seem trivial, it is crucial to understanding the Krechu2013influenced mindset, because individuals adhering to such beliefs employ models from optimal foraging theory to explain how indigenous hunters are not typical predators and are thus, according to their thinking, not ecologically conservationist (Pierotti 2011).  In the organisms under study in this collection, sea otters are the least palatable, being mustelids, but sea lions and fur seals represent much more formidable prey, with teeth and jaws the size and strength of their ursid relatives, especially in the case of Steller sea lions. Thus, many indigenous hunters probably concentrated on the medium sized, sexually monomorphic phocids, such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida Schreber Phocidae) and harbor seals which are less aggressive and dangerous than otariids and more palatable than otters. A more profitable approach is in the use of isotopic analysis, which can reveal whether food is primarily obtained from terrestrial or marine environ-ments, where carbon/nitrogen ratios are markedly different.  Interestingly several of these studies reveal that humans, especially in British Columbia were taking primarily terrestrial prey (deer, moose, etc.) even though they lived in a coastal environment (Chapter 7 by McKechnie and Wigan).  This chapter is dominated by a ten page table that allows the reader to assess the data in considerable detail.  From this table and accompanying figures it is clear that pinni-peds and otters (they include river otters as marine prey) were important prey items only on the outer coast of Vancouver Island, and that most of these  35 Book Review were smaller species like harbor seals, northern fur seals, and otters.  The authors do not include ceta-ceans, which may have been an important food source in this area. One of their most compelling findings is that as Europeans invaded their ranges, the First Nations peoples apparently abandoned taking marine mammals.  This could be either because their own populations were decimated by disease or because of European exploitation patterns, which extirpated populations of fur seals and sea otters. Moss and Losey (Chapter 8) examine human exploitation of the same set of species in the estuaries of Southern Washington and Northern Oregon.  These authors critique the use of optimal foraging theory models, pointing out that size alone may not be an important component of prey choice, especially when accessibility is factored in.  This is a more sophisticated use of optimal foraging theory, which incorporates search and handling times into prey selection. They point out that harbor seals, although relatively small (100-150 kg), are the most consistently available prey, being year-round residents that use regular haulouts, and that they are slow on land. Sea otters are also year-round residents.  These two species make up the preponderance of the prey taken in these areas.  One interesting aspect of this chapter is that they also assess the availability of various species of fishes, which were probably a more important component of overall diet of indigenous peoples. Chapter 9 by Whitaker and Hildebrandt is equivocal, seeming to want to both critique and endorse the Krechian perspective.  Their data suggest that early human hunters had little impact upon the fur seal populations in Northern California that were subsequently extirpated by Europeans, but they close by contending that this was because exploitation of fur seals was an example of u201cprestige economyu201d, in which males were taken preferentially because this conferred higher status on the hunters who took males primarily so their teeth could be used in necklaces, as opposed to being a conservation tactic in which females in a highly polygynous species were not exploited because of management strategies to maintain high population numbers.  Hildebrandt and his regular co-author Jones (primary author of Chapter 11) are the primary Krech disciples represented in this collection. These two co-authored a 1992 study where they argued that indigenous Californians created a u201ctragedy of the commonsu201d that led to over exploitation of pinniped populations, even though there is little evidence that a collapse of these populations ever took place. Hilde-brandt showed a similar ambivalence in a volume of decidedly Krechian cast (Kay and Simmons 2002) where he argued that, even though Aboriginal hunters had eliminated mainland rookeries of pinnipeds, they may not have had much of a negative impact because of the ability of these populations to establish offshore rookeries that were harder to access.  This of course ignores that possibility that the main problem for mainland rookeries may have been the presence of wolves and grizzly bears, which were themselves extirpated after the arrival of European invaders in the 1600s. This means that recent evidence of mainland breeding colonies may not be related to human exploitation.  This is typical of the Krechian approach in which Aboriginal human exploitation is to blame for any identified problem while ignoring 1) the presence and possible impacts of nonhuman preda-tors, and 2) that any evidence of u201coverexploitationu201d is played up, even when there is no evidence of a population decline of the exploited prey (White 2000; Pierotti 2011).  Gifford-Gonzalez (Chapter 10) assesses the history of fur seals around Central California, includ-ing Monterey Bay, arguing that these populations were probably established because the breeding colonies in the Bering Sea and surrounding waters may not have been available during the Neoglacial as discussed by Crockford et al. above.  This suggests that the disappearance of these colonies may have been related to climatic factors, rather than human exploitation.  She also points out that even though there is evidence of Aboriginal exploitation, especially on Au00f1o Nuevo Island, which was connected to the mainland until at least the 19th century, the world metapopulation of this species seem to have been quite stable over the last few thousand years. Only the advent of the European and Japanese sealing industries led to complete extirpation of populations until the estab-lishment of the North Pacific Fur Seal Commission.  In Chapter 11, Jones et al. review the prehistory of the southern sea otter, a subspecies that was almost completely extirpated by Europeans starting with the Russian fur trade in the 1600s.  As noted above, Jones was Hildebrandtu2019s co-author on the 1992 paper and the paper in Kay and Simmons (2002).  As a Krech disciple, he shows a similarly equivocal view of the role of Aboriginal exploitation, arguing that even  36 Book Review though hunting of sea otters, especially females, was intense, that it did not depress populations to such a degree that subsequent commercial exploitation by Europeans was precluded. In the final two chapters, the editors summarize and comment on the data based chapters. In the penultimate chapter (12), they collaborate with the pinniped biologist Bob DeLong, who brings consider-able knowledge of the behavior and ecology of these mammals to the discussion.  I regard this chapter as a model of interdisciplinary work, where archaeologists and marine mammal ecologists work together to produce genuine insights into long term processes. This chapter emphasizes that pre-contact human hunting did impact marine mammal populations, especially in driving rookeries to offshore islands, which are less accessible to humans, even though they make it clear that pinniped populations on San Miguel Island have remained large until recent commercial exploitation by European invaders, despite continued hunting pressure over the last ten thousand years.  This provides little support for the Krechian u201ctragedy of the commonsu201d argued by Hildebrandt, in fact Hildebrandtu2019s own chapter (9) demonstrates that northern fur seal populations did not decline during this period.  Another point made in Chapter 12 is that the predominant species found in middens throughout much of the Channel Islands are Guadalupe fur seal, which today are the only species that is found year round in these islands.  Other supposedly vulnerable species, like northern elephant seal, are found only rarely and may represent scavenging events.  This is important, because as DeLong points out, northern elephant seal weanlings are left unprotected by adults for several months following the breeding season from February through May, yet they are not found in large numbers in the archaeological sites.  In the final chapter (13) the editors summarize the results of this symposium in relation to a set of questions they posed in the opening chapter.  This allows them to address the points of contention without being openly critical, even though it may be inferred that they do not think that Holocene exploi-tation had serious negative impacts upon marine mammal populations, except for some local impacts and possibly forcing rookeries onto smaller less accessible islands and rocks.  They never address the grizzly bear-wolf issue, which also could have forced rookeries and haulouts offshore. The overall consen-sus is that a complex mix of human impacts and climate/environmental changes have shaped marine carnivore populations along the Pacific Coast of North America over the last several millennia. Once European invaders arrived, there was a precipitous decline in all of these species, with extirpation of sea otters and Guadalupe fur seal from many areas.   Thus, the implication in my estimation is that archae-ologists should not assume that human hunting is the primary driver of changes in prehistoric marine mammal population sizes and habitat use patterns. In a way, this comes down to an issue raised in the last few pages of the book, i.e., that archaeological data do not provide the same detailed insights into previous environments and population dynamics that ecological investigations can provide into contempo-rary ecological and exploitation systems.  This volume shows that this should not prevent interdisciplinary approaches where scholars from different disciplines can provide information that is relevant to interpret-ing the processes involved in human and nonhuman interactions.
